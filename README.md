# Watson Assistant Webhook Examples

This repository contains examples of different types of webhook implementations for IBM Watson Assistant.

You can find the examples under ibm-cloud-functions or python-flask. If you want to deploy your webhook on your own cloud infrastructure then we suggest using python-flask. If you want to deploy your webhook on existing IBM cloud infrastructure, we suggest choosing either of the NodeJS or Python examples.
